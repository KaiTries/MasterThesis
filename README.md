# Interaction Protocol and Hypermedia based Multi-Agent Systems

This project presents a novel approach to building autonomous multi-agent systems that combine **BSPL (Blindingly Simple Protocol Language) interaction protocols** with **hypermedia-driven discovery** and **dynamic role binding**. The system enables agents to autonomously discover their environment, negotiate roles, and collaborate through formally specified protocols without requiring centralized coordination.

## Overview

Traditional multi-agent systems often rely on hardcoded agent configurations or centralized orchestration. This project introduces a decentralized approach where:

- **Agents discover protocols and other agents** through hypermedia traversal (using W3C Thing Descriptions)
- **Dynamic role negotiation** allows agents to form systems at runtime through a universal metaprotocol
- **Protocol compliance** is ensured through BSPL formal specifications
- **Hypermedia affordances** guide agent interactions and enable autonomous behavior

The system is particularly suited for scenarios requiring flexible, decentralized coordination between autonomous agents, such as e-commerce transactions, supply chain coordination, or any multi-party business process.

## Key Concepts

### BSPL (Blindingly Simple Protocol Language)

BSPL is a formal language for specifying interaction protocols. A protocol defines:
- **Roles**: Participants in the interaction (e.g., Buyer, Seller)
- **Parameters**: Information exchanged, with adornments (in/out/nil) and optionally marked as keys
- **Messages**: Communications between roles with specific parameter flows

**Example - Buy Protocol:**
```bspl
Buy {
  roles Buyer, Seller
  parameters out buyID key, out itemID key, out item, out money

  Buyer -> Seller: Pay[out buyID key, out itemID key, out money]
  Seller -> Buyer: Give[in buyID key, in itemID key, in money, out item]
}
```

BSPL ensures protocols are **enactable**, **dead-lock free**, and **information-safe** through formal verification.

### MetaAdapter

The `MetaAdapter` is an extension of the base BSPL `Adapter` that adds:

1. **Dynamic Protocol Management**: Add new protocols at runtime
2. **Dynamic System Formation**: Create protocol enactments with agents discovered at runtime
3. **Role Negotiation**: Built-in metaprotocol for proposing and accepting roles
4. **Capability-Based Role Matching**: Automatically determine which roles an agent can enact
5. **Agent Discovery Integration**: Add and manage agent addresses dynamically

### Role Negotiation Metaprotocol

A universally known metaprotocol enables agents to dynamically bind roles for any protocol:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant I as Initiator (MetaAdapter)
    participant C as Candidate (MetaAdapter)

    Note over I: Create system for desired protocol<br/>only own role is filled
    Note over I: Initiate role negotiation with candidates

    I->>C: OfferRole
    Note over C: Upon reception, build metaprotocol system<br/>Reasoning must be implemented by user

    alt Candidate accepts
        C-->>I: Accept
        I->>C: SystemDetails
        Note over I,C: Sent once all roles are filled<br/>All agents add system to their adapter
    else Candidate rejects
        C-->>I: Reject
        Note over I: Optionally re-offer to another candidate
    end
```

### Hypermedia-Driven Discovery

Agents use **semantic hypermedia** (W3C Thing Descriptions) to discover everything they need:
- **Workspaces** through autonomous crawling from a base URL (NEW!)
- **Other agents** in the environment and their capabilities
- **Protocols** needed for specific goals (linked from resources)
- **Endpoints** for communication with other agents
- **Roles** that agents can enact

**Example:** An agent starting with only `http://localhost:8080/` can autonomously crawl through workspaces to find the one containing its goal artifact, then join that workspace and complete its task - all without hardcoded paths!

## Building Agents with MetaAdapter

You have two approaches for building agents:

1. **HypermediaMetaAdapter** (Recommended) - Unified adapter with integrated hypermedia capabilities
2. **MetaAdapter + HypermediaTools** - Manual coordination for more control

### Approach 1: HypermediaMetaAdapter (Recommended)

The `HypermediaMetaAdapter` combines BSPL protocol enactment with hypermedia discovery in a single, cohesive abstraction. This is the recommended approach for new agents.

**Quick Example (with Workspace Discovery):**

```python
from HypermediaMetaAdapter import HypermediaMetaAdapter

# Agent discovers workspace autonomously!
adapter = HypermediaMetaAdapter(
    name="BuyerAgent",
    base_uri="http://localhost:8080/",  # Just the entry point
    goal_artifact_uri="http://localhost:8080/workspaces/bazaar/artifacts/rug#artifact",
    web_id="http://localhost:8011",
    adapter_endpoint="8011",
    capabilities={"Pay"},
    auto_discover_workspace=True,  # Crawls to find workspace
    auto_join=True  # Automatically joins discovered workspace
)

# Define message handler
@adapter.reaction("Give")
async def handle_give(msg):
    adapter.info(f"Received item: {msg['item']}")
    return msg

# High-level workflow
async def main():
    adapter.start_in_loop()

    # One method does: discover protocol, agents, propose system, negotiate roles
    system_name = await adapter.discover_and_propose_system(
        protocol_name="Buy",
        system_name="BuySystem",
        my_role="Buyer",
        goal_item_uri="http://localhost:8080/workspaces/bazaar/artifacts/rug#artifact"
    )

    # Built-in waiting for system formation
    if await adapter.wait_for_system_formation(system_name, timeout=10.0):
        await adapter.initiate_protocol("Buy/Pay", {...})

    adapter.leave_workspace()
```

**Key Benefits:**
- 🚀 **~42% less code** compared to manual approach
- 🔍 **Workspace discovery** through autonomous crawling (NEW!)
- ✨ **Automatic workspace management** (join/leave)
- 🔎 **Built-in discovery methods** for agents and protocols
- 🎯 **High-level workflows** that handle multiple steps
- 🛡️ **Context manager support** for automatic cleanup
- 📚 **Cleaner, more maintainable code**

- [WORKSPACE_DISCOVERY.md](HypermediaInteractionProtocols/agents/WORKSPACE_DISCOVERY.md) - Autonomous workspace crawling (NEW!)

### Approach 2: MetaAdapter + HypermediaTools (Manual)

This approach gives you fine-grained control by manually coordinating between `MetaAdapter` and `HypermediaTools`. Use this when you need precise control over each step.

This tutorial demonstrates how to build autonomous agents using the `MetaAdapter` class. We'll use the buyer and seller agents from the demo as reference.

### Step 1: Initialize Your Agent

```python
from bspl.adapter import MetaAdapter

# Configuration
NAME = "MyAgent"
ENDPOINT_PORT = 8011
SELF = [('127.0.0.1', ENDPOINT_PORT)]

# Define what messages your agent can send (capabilities)
# Capabilities are message names that your agent implements
capabilities = {"Pay", "AcceptOrder"}  # Example capabilities

# Create the MetaAdapter
adapter = MetaAdapter(
    name=NAME,
    systems={},  # Start with no systems (add dynamically)
    agents={NAME: SELF},  # Start with only self in address book
    capabilities=capabilities,
    debug=False
)
```

### Step 2: Define Message Handlers (Capabilities)

Message handlers react to incoming messages. Use the `@adapter.reaction()` decorator:

```python
@adapter.reaction("Give")
async def handle_give_message(msg):
    """Handle incoming Give messages from the Buy protocol"""
    adapter.info(f"Received item: {msg['item']}")
    adapter.info(f"Order {msg['buyID']} completed!")
    return msg
```

You can also define **enabled message generators** that automatically bind parameters when messages become enabled:

```python
@adapter.enabled("Buy/Give")
async def auto_send_give(msg):
    """Automatically send Give when enabled after receiving Pay"""
    adapter.info(f"Received payment for {msg['itemID']}")
    # Bind the 'item' parameter
    return msg.bind(item=msg['itemID'])
```

### Step 3: Add Protocols Dynamically

Once you discover a protocol (e.g., from hypermedia), add it to your adapter:

```python
import bspl

# Load protocol from string or file
protocol_string = """
Buy {
  roles Buyer, Seller
  parameters out buyID key, out itemID key, out item, out money

  Buyer -> Seller: Pay[out buyID key, out itemID key, out money]
  Seller -> Buyer: Give[in buyID key, in itemID key, in money, out item]
}
"""

# Parse and add protocol
spec = bspl.load(protocol_string)
protocol = spec.protocols['Buy']
adapter.add_protocol(protocol)

# The adapter automatically determines which roles you can enact
# based on your declared capabilities
```

### Step 4: Discover and Add Other Agents

```python
from helpers import get_agents

# Get agents from hypermedia environment
agents = get_agents(workspace_url, own_artifact_address)

# Add discovered agents to address book
for agent in agents:
    adapter.upsert_agent(agent.name, agent.addresses)
```

### Step 5: Propose a System and Negotiate Roles

```python
# Define the system you want to create
system_dict = {
    "protocol": protocol,
    "roles": {
        "Buyer": NAME,        # Your agent takes Buyer role
        "Seller": None        # Seller role to be negotiated
    }
}

# Propose the system (internal tracking)
proposed_system_name = adapter.propose_system("BuySystem_1", system_dict)

# Offer roles to discovered agents
await adapter.offer_roles(system_dict, proposed_system_name, agents)
```

The metaprotocol handles the negotiation automatically:
- Candidates with matching capabilities will accept
- When all roles are filled, all agents receive system details
- The system becomes ready for protocol enactment

### Step 6: Initiate Protocol Messages

```python
import asyncio

# Wait for the system to be well-formed (all roles filled)
await asyncio.sleep(5)  # Or implement proper waiting logic

if adapter.proposed_systems.get_system(proposed_system_name).is_well_formed():
    # Create message parameters
    params = {
        "system": proposed_system_name,
        "buyID": "order_123",
        "itemID": "rug",
        "money": 100
    }

    # Initiate the protocol
    await adapter.initiate_protocol("Buy/Pay", params)
else:
    adapter.info("System not well-formed, cannot initiate protocol")
```

### Step 7: Start the Adapter

```python
# Start in existing event loop (non-blocking)
async def main():
    adapter.start_in_loop()
    # Your agent logic here
    # ...

asyncio.run(main())

# OR start with dedicated event loop (blocking)
if __name__ == "__main__":
    adapter.start()
```

### Complete Agent Example

Here's a minimal working seller agent:

```python
from bspl.adapter import MetaAdapter
import bspl

# Configuration
NAME = "SellerAgent"
SELF = [('127.0.0.1', 8010)]
capabilities = {"Give"}

# Create adapter
adapter = MetaAdapter(
    name=NAME,
    systems={},
    agents={NAME: SELF},
    capabilities=capabilities,
    debug=True
)

# Define capability
@adapter.enabled("Buy/Give")
async def send_give(msg):
    adapter.info(f"Received order for {msg['itemID']}, sending item...")
    return msg.bind(item=msg['itemID'])

# Main logic
async def main():
    # Load protocol
    protocol_str = """
    Buy {
      roles Buyer, Seller
      parameters out buyID key, out itemID key, out item, out money
      Buyer -> Seller: Pay[out buyID key, out itemID key, out money]
      Seller -> Buyer: Give[in buyID key, in itemID key, in money, out item]
    }
    """
    spec = bspl.load(protocol_str)
    adapter.add_protocol(spec.protocols['Buy'])

    # Start adapter
    adapter.start_in_loop()

    # Agent stays alive and handles incoming messages
    while True:
        await asyncio.sleep(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Advanced Features

**Custom Role Proposal Handling:**

The MetaAdapter has default handlers for role negotiation, but you can override them:

```python
# Override the default role proposal handler
@adapter.reaction("RoleNegotiation/OfferRole")
async def custom_role_handler(msg):
    proposed_role = msg['proposedRole']
    protocol_name = msg['protocolName']

    # Custom logic to decide acceptance
    if should_accept(proposed_role, protocol_name):
        await adapter.send(
            adapter.meta_protocol.messages["Accept"](
                uuid=msg['uuid'],
                system=msg.system,
                protocolName=msg['protocolName'],
                systemName=msg['systemName'],
                proposedRole=msg['proposedRole'],
                accept=True
            )
        )
    else:
        # Send reject...
        pass
    return msg
```

**Accessing System Information:**

```python
# Get a specific system
system = adapter.systems.get_system("BuySystem_1")
print(f"Roles: {system.roles}")
print(f"Protocol: {system.protocol.name}")

# Check if system is well-formed
if system.is_well_formed():
    adapter.info("All roles assigned!")

# Access proposed systems (during negotiation)
proposed = adapter.proposed_systems.get_system(proposed_system_name)
```

## Demo Scenario

### Motivating Scenario

> AI-Agents browsing the web is a common occurrence nowadays and a vital functionality for these agents is
> to be able to conduct transactions. Therefore, our scenario is a simple but illustrative buy scenario, where
> a user agent will have the goal to buy a specific item - _a rug_. The user agent will then autonomously discover its
> environment and through interactions with other agents buy the wanted item for the user. The user agent does this with initial knowledge
> of only an **entrypoint**, an identifier for the **wanted item** and basic capabilities to respond to **buy specific messages**.

### How to Run the Demo

1. Start the environment and bazaar agent:

```bash
cd HypermediaInteractionProtocols
./start.sh
```

This starts:
- **Yggdrasil** (hypermedia environment on port 8080)
- **Bazaar Agent** (seller agent on port 8010)

2. Open a new terminal and start the buyer agent:

```bash
cd HypermediaInteractionProtocols/agents
python buyer_agent.py
```

### What Happens in the Demo

1. **Buyer joins workspace**: The buyer agent joins the bazaar workspace through hypermedia
2. **Protocol discovery**: Buyer discovers the Buy protocol linked from the goal item (rug)
3. **Agent discovery**: Buyer discovers the bazaar agent (seller) in the workspace
4. **Protocol addition**: Buyer adds the Buy protocol and determines it can enact the "Buyer" role (has "Pay" capability)
5. **System proposal**: Buyer proposes a system with itself as Buyer and Seller role unfilled
6. **Role negotiation**: Buyer offers the Seller role to the bazaar agent via the metaprotocol
7. **Role acceptance**: Bazaar agent accepts (has "Give" capability)
8. **System formation**: Once all roles are filled, both agents receive system details
9. **Protocol enactment**: Buyer initiates the Buy protocol by sending Pay message
10. **Transaction completion**: Seller responds with Give message, completing the transaction

**Console Output** shows:
- Agent joining/leaving workspace
- Protocol and agent discovery
- Role negotiation messages
- Protocol messages (Pay/Give)
- Transaction completion

### Demo Implementation Details

**Buyer Agent** (HypermediaInteractionProtocols/agents/buyer_agent.py:1-134):
- Joins workspace via hypermedia
- Discovers Buy protocol from goal item semantics
- Discovers and adds other agents
- Proposes system and negotiates roles
- Initiates the Buy protocol

**Bazaar/Seller Agent** (HypermediaInteractionProtocols/agents/bazaar_agent.py:1-137):
- Registers with workspace on startup
- Adds Buy protocol and advertises "Seller" role capability
- Responds to role offers via default metaprotocol handler
- Automatically sends Give message when Pay is received (enabled message generator)

### Key Features Demonstrated

#### Dynamic Role Binding

The metaprotocol allows agents to form systems without prior coordination:
- **Decentralized**: No central authority assigns roles
- **Flexible**: Agents can join/leave systems dynamically
- **Capability-based**: Agents accept roles based on their advertised capabilities
- **Protocol-agnostic**: Works with any BSPL protocol

#### Hypermedia-Driven Discovery

Agents discover everything they need through hypermedia:
- **Protocols**: Linked from goal items using semantic annotations
- **Agents**: Discovered by traversing workspace artifacts
- **Capabilities**: Agents advertise their roles in Thing Descriptions
- **Endpoints**: Communication addresses discovered from action affordances

#### Protocol Compliance

BSPL ensures correct protocol execution:
- **Message ordering**: Only enabled messages can be sent
- **Parameter flow**: Information flows correctly between messages
- **Integrity checking**: Duplicate/invalid messages are rejected
- **Deadlock freedom**: Protocols are verified to be enactable
